How to control LEDs with TV remote ‚Äì Arduino
1
Control LED with IR remote
Today I‚Äôm going to show you how to control any device with an Infrared remote(TV,DVD,AC etc.) and with the help of Arduino board. So lets get started.

Things you‚Äôll need :-

Infrared receiver (I‚Äôm using one from the TSOP 17** series)
Arduino board.
Breadboard.
Couple of jumpers/single stranded wires.
A LED Any remote(AC, TV, DVD player).
Connections :-
Connections of Infrared receiver with Arduino
Connections of Infrared receiver with Arduino
Of Infrared reciever-
Pin 1 ‚Äì                           GND (Ground pin of Arduino).
Pin 2/Middle pin ‚Äì     VCC (5v supply of Arduino).
Pin 3 ‚Äì                           Data pin (pin number 3 on Arduino).

Note :- The pin no. 3 is a bit separated from the other two ! Don‚Äôt misunderstand between pin1 & pin3 !

Procedure :-
First things first, make the connections.
Now to turn ON/OFF any LED with the help of any remote we must know the value/code of the button through which we are going to change the state !
Download the IRemote library online from this link. Copy & paste the code I‚Äôve provided. Upload it.
After uploading, click on the Serial Moniter option in the top right corner of Arduino window.
Press the buttons you wish to control your LED with. Note down the values which appear in the Serial monitor window.
Making changes in your code by replacing YOUR values with ‚ÄúYOUR VALUE 1‚Äù & ‚ÄúYOUR VALUE 2‚Äù in the code.
Again upload the code & test it out !
Code :-

#include <IRremote.h>
 
int RECV_PIN = 3;               //declared for receiving pulses
int c=0;                        // declared if you want to control with a single button
IRrecv irrecv(RECV_PIN);
decode_results results;


void setup()
{
   pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
   Serial.begin(9600);
  irrecv.enableIRIn();                      // Start the receiver
}

void loop() {
  if (irrecv.decode(&results)) {
    Serial.println(results.value);
    irrecv.resume();                        // Receive the next value
  if(results.value==YOUR VALUE1)                                       
  {
             digitalWrite(9,HIGH);
  }
  else if(results.value==YOUR VALUE2)
  {
             digitalWrite(9,LOW);
  }
                                }
}


/* if((results.value== YOUR VALUE3)&&(c%2==1))                    // enables you to turn on & off with the help of same button"                  
  {
                digitalWrite(9,HIGH);
  }
  else if((results.value==YOUR VALUE3)&&(c%2==0))
  {
                digitalWrite(9,LOW);
  }
  c++;
 }}*/

It was a bit tough to understand just by reading
But the video made it a lot simpler
You should make more Ardino DIY

P.S.- Do you know from where i should get this stuff
